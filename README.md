# Gender-Based-Employee-Distribution-Dashboard🏢

This repository houses the gender-based employee distribution from the years 1990 to 2002.
The queries have been coded in SQL and the resultant information has been visualized as a dashboard using Tableau Public.

The following analysis has been performed on the dataset-
- Breakdown of the number of male vs female employees hired over the years
- Number of male vs female managers per department over the years
- Average annual male vs female employee salary trend over the years
- Department-wise average male vs female employee salary
